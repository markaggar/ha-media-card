## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added - Major Features

#### üìÇ Hierarchical Folder Scanning System
- **Smart Queue Management**: Intelligently discovers and selects media across hundreds of folders with thousands of files
- **Progressive Content Discovery**: Shows content immediately while continuing background scanning
- **Equal Probability Mode**: Fair representation ensuring each photo has equal selection chance regardless of folder size
- **Priority Folder Patterns**: Configure specific folders (e.g., "/Camera Roll/") to receive higher selection weight (3x default)
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Multiple folders processed simultaneously for faster discovery
- **Randomized Scan Order**: Folders scanned in random order to prevent alphabetical bias in early queue population
- **Background Pause Detection**: Scanning automatically pauses when card is not visible and resumes on return
- **Queue Persistence**: Maintains queue state when card reconnects to avoid re-scanning

#### üñºÔ∏è Rich Metadata Display System
- **Folder Information**: Shows source folder path with clean presentation
- **Filename Display**: Clean filename with authentication signature removal
- **Smart Date Extraction**: Automatic date parsing from filenames (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYYMMDD, MM-DD-YYYY, and more)
- **Flexible Positioning**: 4 corner placement options (bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, top-right)
- **Individual Component Toggles**: Enable/disable folder, filename, or date display independently
- **Theme Integration**: Automatically adapts to Home Assistant light/dark themes

#### üé¨ Video Completion Intelligence
- **Auto-advance After Completion**: Videos advance to next item immediately when finished playing
- **Smart Wait Detection**: Handles edge cases where video duration doesn't match actual playback
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with slideshow timing to prevent premature advances

#### ‚è∏Ô∏è Smart Pause Management
- **Video Pause Detection**: Slideshow automatically pauses when user manually pauses a video
- **Manual Pause Control**: Click pause indicator or use keyboard shortcuts
- **Background Activity Management**: Scans and slideshow pause when card not visible
- **Resume on Return**: Automatically resumes when card becomes visible again

### Changed

- **BREAKING (Minor)**: Deprecated `subfolder_queue.queue_size` in favor of unified `slideshow_window` setting
  - Automatic migration: Existing configs migrate on load
  - `slideshow_window` serves dual purpose: hard limit (legacy) or probability target (SubfolderQueue)
  - Default value: 1000 (suitable for both modes)
- Removed `queue_size` field from UI editor
- Improved early queue diversity by randomizing subfolder scan order
- Enhanced logging and debug output for hierarchical scanning

### Fixed

- **Queue Initialization**: Fixed `isScanning` flag stuck in true state causing slideshow to never resume
- **Duplicate Media Loading**: Added `_isLoadingMedia` flag to prevent videos being immediately replaced during startup
- **Priority Patterns UI**: Fixed textarea editing issue where content would reset on each render
- **Path Change Detection**: Fixed `pathChanged` showing undefined on first load
- **Scan Termination**: Fixed premature scan stopping due to bad timeout detection
- **Equal Probability Allocation**: Fixed 0 slot allocation during early discovery phase
- Improved documentation with migration notes and updated examples
