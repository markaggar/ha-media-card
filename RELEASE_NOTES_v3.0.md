# Home Assistant Media Card v3.0 üéâ

Transform your photo and video collection into a beautiful, dynamic slideshow experience in Home Assistant.

## ‚ú® What's New

### üå≤ Smart Hierarchical Scanning
Your media card now intelligently scans deep folder structures, discovering photos and videos across hundreds of subdirectories. Perfect for large collections organized by year, event, or person.

**Why you'll love it:** No more seeing the same folder's images repeatedly. Get true variety from your entire collection without manual configuration.

### üé¨ Seamless Video Integration
Videos now play to completion before advancing, with proper pause/resume support. Mix photos and videos naturally in your slideshow.

**Why you'll love it:** Videos are first-class citizens now. No more jarring interruptions or skipped content.

### üìä Beautiful Metadata Display
See exactly what's playing with elegant overlays showing filename, folder, and date information. Customize visibility and positioning to your preference.

**Why you'll love it:** Rediscover forgotten memories and know exactly where your photos came from.

### üéØ Priority Folder Patterns
Mark your favorite folders (e.g., "Family", "Vacation") to appear 3x more often in the slideshow rotation.

**Why you'll love it:** See your best content more frequently while still enjoying variety from your full collection.

### üé≤ Enhanced Random Mode
True randomization with smart history tracking. Navigate backward and forward through previously shown media, with duplicate prevention.

**Why you'll love it:** Feels like a well-curated playlist, not a chaotic shuffle.

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Smart Pause System
Pause with a single click. Automatically pauses when you manually control videos. Visual indicators show pause state clearly.

**Why you'll love it:** Full control when you need it, smooth automation when you don't.

### üñ±Ô∏è Improved Navigation
Larger, easier-to-click navigation zones that work perfectly whether your photos are portrait or landscape.

**Why you'll love it:** No more hunting for tiny buttons when the image orientation changes.

## üîß Configuration Improvements

### Unified Settings
- **`slideshow_window`** replaces the old `queue_size` setting (automatic migration)
- Simplified configuration with sensible defaults
- Better documentation and examples

### Performance Tuning
- Optimized scanning for large collections (25,000+ photos tested)
- Concurrent folder processing for faster initialization
- Smart timeout protection prevents hanging on slow network shares
